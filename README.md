# Email Explorer

Email Explorer is a full-stack, serverless email client that runs entirely on your own Cloudflare account. It provides a modern, fast, and secure way to manage your emails using Cloudflare's powerful infrastructure, including Workers, R2, Durable Objects, Email Routing, and Email Sending.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/G4brym/email-explorer/tree/main/template)

## Overview

Email Explorer gives you a private, self-hosted email solution with a user-friendly web interface. By leveraging the Cloudflare ecosystem, it offers a cost-effective and scalable alternative to traditional email hosting. All your data is stored securely in your own R2 buckets and Durable Objects, giving you full control over your information.

When you first load your worker, there will be no mailbox, they will be automatically created when you start receiving emails on your worker.

```
Please note that for sending emails, you will need to have you Cloudflare account with Email sending enabled!
```

## Key Features

- **🔒 Secure & Private**: Self-hosted on your Cloudflare account. No third-party tracking or data scanning.
- **🔐 Smart Authentication**: Automatic first-user admin setup with role-based access control.
- **👥 Multi-User Support**: Admin panel for managing users and mailbox permissions.
- **✉️ Email Management**: Send, receive, and organize emails with a clean and intuitive interface.
- **📁 Folder Organization**: Create custom folders to organize your emails.
- **📎 Attachment Support**: View and download attachments directly in the browser.
- **⚡ Serverless Architecture**: Each mailbox is its own durable object.

## Getting Started

To deploy Email Explorer, you can use the "Deploy to Cloudflare" button above or run this command:

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template=https://github.com/G4brym/email-explorer/tree/main/template
```

### Configuration

Email Explorer uses a factory function pattern for configuration. Edit `src/index.ts`:

```typescript
// Recommended: Smart Mode (Default)
export default EmailExplorer({
  auth: {
    enabled: true
    // registerEnabled not specified = smart mode
  }
})
```

**Smart Mode (Recommended):**
- First user to register automatically becomes admin
- Registration closes after first user
- Admins can create additional users via admin panel
- Perfect for production deployments

**Other Modes:**
```typescript
// Open Registration (Development/Testing)
export default EmailExplorer({
  auth: {
    enabled: true,
    registerEnabled: true  // Anyone can register
  }
})

// No Authentication (Single User)
export default EmailExplorer({
  auth: {
    enabled: false
  }
})
```

### First-Time Setup

1. **Deploy your worker** with smart mode enabled (default)
2. **Visit your worker URL** in a browser
3. **Register the first user** - this becomes your admin account
4. **Log in** with your admin credentials
5. **Manage additional users** through the admin panel

### Admin Operations

As an admin, you can:
- Create new users
- Grant/revoke mailbox access
- Assign roles: `owner`, `admin`, `write`, or `read`
- Promote users to admin status

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for detailed API documentation and configuration options.
